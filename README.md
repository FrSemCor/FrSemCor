## Corpus of semantically annotated French nouns

**Authors** : Lucie Barque, Pauline Haas, Richard Huyghe, Delphine Tribout, Marie Candito, Benoit Crabbé et Vincent Segonne

**The project** 

The project aims at compensating for the lack of semantically annotated data that can be used in both NLP and linguistics research. We provide a gold standard resource for French nouns, based on a careful semantic annotation designed and supervised by lexical semantics experts. 

### Annotation guide

We have designed an [annotation guide]() (in French) during a preliminary annotation phase. Then % of nominal tokens from the 
[Sequoia corpus](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/alpage-wiki/tiki-index.php?page=CorpusSequoia) corpus have been doubly-annotated by three French native students.

### Resulting corpus
The [resulting corpus]() contains xxx occurrences of nouns, annotated into 24 supersenses (+ complex supersenses). The following 
table indicates the distribution of the 20 most frequent supersenses in adjudicated data.

The corpus is freely available, under the [LGPL-LR](https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPLLR.html) licence.
