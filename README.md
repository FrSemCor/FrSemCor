## FrSemCor, a corpus of semantically annotated French nouns

**Authors** : Lucie Barque, Pauline Haas, Richard Huyghe, Delphine Tribout, Marie Candito, Benoit Crabbé and Vincent Segonne

**The project** 

The project aims at compensating for the lack of semantically annotated data that can be used in both NLP and linguistics research. We provide a gold standard resource for French nouns, based on a careful semantic annotation designed. 

### Annotation guide

We have designed an [annotation guide](https://github.com/FrSemCor/FrSemCor/blob/master/guideAnno-FR-SemCor.pdf) (in French) during a preliminary annotation phase. Then 73% of the noun tokens from the 
[Sequoia corpus](https://deep-sequoia.inria.fr) corpus have been doubly-annotated by three French native students. They were adjudicated, and all noun tokens were validated by an expert. 

### Resulting corpus
The [resulting corpus](https://github.com/FrSemCor/FrSemCor/blob/master/sequoia-9.1.frsemcor) (information on file format [here](https://github.com/FrSemCor/FrSemCor/blob/master/fr_semcor_format)) contains 12,917 noun tokens, annotated into 24 supersenses (+ complex supersenses). 

Our annotation are compliant with the annotation of named entities and (nominal) multiword expressions performed in the [Parseme-fr](https://gitlab.lis-lab.fr/PARSEME-FR/PARSEME-FR-public/) project.

The corpus is freely available, under the [LGPL-LR](https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPLLR.html) licence.
